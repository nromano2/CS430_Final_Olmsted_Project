# CS430_Final_Olmsted_Project
This the Olmsted Final Project for the CS43O Machine Learning in the Cloud Course. For this project we tried to predict high levels of invasie species within trimble stations within Cherokee, Shawnee, and Secena Parks.  

The `Overall_Final_CS430_Notebook` is the Juptyer Notebook for this project that contains data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and modeling.  

The `2022InvasiveSurvey_Edited.xlsx` and `2024InvasiveSpeciesSurvey_Edited` are the Excel files where the survey data on the trimble stations are located.   

The `Final_Olmsted2022_Data.csv` and `Final_Olmsted2022_2024_Data.csv` are the cleaned finals with contain the cleaned 2022 data and comabined 2022 and 2024 data. The `Final_Olmsted2022_2024_Data.csv` was the data used for our modeling. The three 2022 and 2024 Park data sets are the condensed version of `Final_Olmsted2022_2024_Data.csv` that focuses on trimble stations focusing on Cherokee, Secena, and Shawnee Parks.   

The `Olmsted_Report.pdf` is the report of our findings.
